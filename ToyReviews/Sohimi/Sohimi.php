						<b>Alright! So first things first, the makers of this toy sent me one for free to test. If anybody wants to buy something on <a href="https://www.sohimi.com/products/eliza-hands-free-male-masturbator-2?ref=BadFuckingDog">their store</a> you can use the code KNOT10 at checkout for 10% off, and it will give me commission!</b>
						<span style="display:block; height: 1vw;"></span>
						<span style="display:inline-block; width: 2vw;"></span>This is the first automatic stroker I've ever used. It comes with a micro usb charger, a pair of earbuds, (which we will talk about shortly...) and a suction cup mount. The obvious selling point about the toy is that it has a motorized stroking funtion. It has a battery powered motor that moves the toy on a set of rails about two inches up and down at a few set speeds. The penetratable part of the toy is made of a very soft silicone (similar to a fleshlight, rather than a silicone dildo). It feels reasonably durable, and unlikely to split or degrade. The heaphones are for listening to the pre recorded sex sounds stored on the toy... If you're into that. (is anybody into that?)

						<span style="display:inline-block; width: 2vw;"></span><b>TL;DR:</b> The toy has a fair share of design flaws, but I think it is actually really impressive what you get for the cost.

							The Good Rant

						<span class="textparagraph" style="width: 40vw; margin: 1.5vw; vertical-align: top;">
							Getting a free toy sent to me admittedly made me very skeptical about what it would be like. It literally arrived less than 24 hours after I agreed to take it since it shipped from Ohio, so perks if you are in the US. I was surprised by the build quality, its made out of a very thick and hard plastic so I didn't feel like I need to be careful with it. The choice of silicone hardness for the toy is a good one. It's quite soft so it doesn't overstimulate like the harder toys I have, but its not too soft like the fleshlite-type toys that barely feel like anything. A happy medium in my opinion. Honestly, for 70$ USD the toy just as a static stroker is probably more enjoyable than a brand name fleshlite. That being said, <b>it isn't</b> a static stroker.<br>
							<span style="display:inline-block; width: 2vw;"></span>Once I had it set up and properly situated, I actually really enjoyed using this thing. I found that it worked best if I set it up attached to the shower wall. The silicone sleeve doesn't have an air vent, so I'd start by sticking my dick all the way in to create suction before turning on the stroking function, then I'd pull out until the toy was sucking the first few inches of me in and out on its own. I found it was a really nice toy to edge with since I could kind of pull out and then reposition myself repetedly until I decided to finish. The mere fact that something else is setting the tempo makes it a nice change of pace from jerking off yourself, and I think that's the real appeal to this toy.

							With a complicated toy like this, there's a lot that can go wrong. Where do I start? ...I think the most glaring issue for me was the motor. This might be less of an issue for people who aren't as thick, but I found it very hard to use the toy without the motor seizing up. (see the video) If you weren't lined up at the right angle, or if you push in too deep the motor doesnt actually have the power to cycle the stroker. Interestingly, if you tear the device apart you'll find a reasonably high speed motor that's been geared down to give it a bit more power to push the toy. Since the strokes are really fast, it makes me wonder why they didnt gear it down a little more to fix this. The next, somewhat related issue to me was the usable length. The actual cup that moves up and down is not very deep, and the silicone sleeve that goes into it has a thick pad at the bottom. The result is that the usable length is only ~4.5 inches:

						<span class="textparagraph" style="width: 40vw; margin: 1.5vw">
							The last issue that I had with this toy was the suction cup. This may seem like a nitpick, but it was not very stable. It had a decent looking locking mechinism, but it seemed like the lock barely did anything and it was more just a sticky pad than a sealing suction cup. It actually fell off the wall after I'd used it a few times and damaged the toy, so this is a bit more important than you'd think.
